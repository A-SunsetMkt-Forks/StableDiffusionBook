# Initialization

This section describes the Debug and some optimization solutions for the model parameters to make it work better. The model used for the demonstration in this section is `some model` to expand the tutorial. **Some source tutorials from: [^2]**

It is recommended to frequently pull code from remote code repositories `git pull` to update WebUI web applications.

SDWebUi is a framework with many [models] like for example `some model` (https://rentry.org/sdmodels)


## Model selection

The dataset and labels used by the model are very important for the impact of the results.

It is important to understand the source of the data before using it.


### Some model

here is a brief talk about guessing with some models.

- Guesses

For a well-known model, `masterpiece' is likely to be an artificially tagged Tag to suit commercial needs.

The guess is that the full model puts in all the data, unpurged. The basic model, on the other hand, has more accurate data and should be cleaned.

This leads to the instability of the full model.

In "Event 2" we saw many other models, such as the `wallpaper` model, which should have been trained using different datasets.

After some discussion, we believe that some models are classified according to `rating`.


But we don't actually know the details, so the above is just a guess and **not credible**.
