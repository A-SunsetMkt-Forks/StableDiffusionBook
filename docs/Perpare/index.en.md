# Preparation

The purpose of this document is to summarize the results of the community discussion and to create a self-help guide for people who are new to drawing with Stable Diffusion, starting with WebUi and learning about Ai drawing.

!!! tip
    The repository currently contains a machine-translated version of the guide, if this does not seem to flow well to you or has errors.

    Or would like a version in another language. Then please submit Issue or Pr

## Asking polite questions in the community

[How To Ask Questions The Smart Way] (https://github.com/selfteaching/How-To-Ask-Questions-The-Smart-Way)

If you identify something wrong or something important to add, you can send **Issue** or submit **Pr** to this repository to help complete the documentation and help more people.

Communication is welcome, but no nonsense is welcome. Please make sure yourself that there is no explanation in the documentation before asking a question, and you should understand that no one or community member has an obligation to answer your question without having a stake in it.

If you see a section you don't recognize, chances are your version is too low.


## Can I play this?

First, unfortunately, because it requires `CUDA` acceleration, only **Nvidia graphics cards** are well supported. (AMD works but is significantly slower than Nvidia graphics, ~ of course without a graphics card it can take hundreds of times longer to generate with a CPU ~)



**Linux + AMD** Please Read [AMD Guide](https://rentry.org/ayymd-stable-diffustion-v1_4-guide) å’Œ [AMD install WebUi Wiki](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/Install-and-Run-on-AMD-GPUs)


[Discussion about installing on Amd](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/discussions/1046)

!!! danger "graphics card warranty"
    In mainland China, the warranty policy of graphics card manufacturers for deep learning cards is equivalent to that of mining cards
    Overplaying (e.g. 3 consecutive days out of the map), the graphics card will risk to break down

## Current five options

| Name | Requirements | Effectiveness |
|------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SdWebui(4GB Leak model) | 3GB video memory barely | 4GB video memory is eaten up by 512x512, default speed 17s |
| SdWebui(7GB Leak model) | 8GB video memory | Not much difference from 4GB, but the data has the last training weights, so it consumes more video memory |
| Naifu(4GB Leak model) | Minimum 8GB video memory & 8GB video memory | Close to official |
| Naifu(7GB Leak model) | Minimum 8GB video memory (10GB upward) | Close to official |
| Official Backend | 16GBfp16/24GBfp32 & Server System | 99.9 similar to official |


The original NAI web UI + backend deployment requires a GPU server with 12GB or more of video memory on a *Linux system*. NAI officially uses the full model, but it requires a lot of video memory, so you'll need a 7W A100 graphics card from Taobao.

SDWebUi is a **framework** that can use models to produce images.

NAI is an online **service**.

## Don't want to generate anime pictures?

If you want to get models that don't generate anime girls, please see [here](https://space.bilibili.com/250989068/channel/collectiondetail?sid=660352).

By the way post a [recently released 1.5 model](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5) and [stable small size 1.4 model](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-) diffusion-v1-4)
