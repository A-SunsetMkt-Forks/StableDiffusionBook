Our mission is to create helpful guides that anyone can contribute to. Let’s build together!

### Quick Introduction

**Stable Diffusion** is a special AI tool that creates realistic and unique images based on descriptions or other images. People use it for designing ads, posters, websites, and more. This guide mainly focuses on [Stable Diffusion WebUi (SDWebUi)](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui), a user-friendly interface for image creation. Other tools, like [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI), are also important in this community.

### How Stable Diffusion and NovelAI Are Connected

NovelAI made a second-generation Stable Diffusion model trained on a huge collection of anime and artwork. Later, they released a third-generation model with improved, diverse styles, which has become popular for making high-quality anime and illustration images.

**Leak Information:**
- Part 1: Models and programs (53.66 GB)
- Part 2: Historical test codes and models (124.54 GB)

This leak actually boosted the text-to-image field, inspiring more models and tools.
